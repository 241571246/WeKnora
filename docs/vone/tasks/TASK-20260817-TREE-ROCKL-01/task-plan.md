- Plan Accountable Owner: ROCKL
- Historical Executor: N/A
- Technical Approver: ROCKL
- Maintenance Developer Owner: ROCKL
- QA Owner: RockL
- QA Second Reviewer: TBD — distinct human required
- QA Independence Exception Approver: TBD — distinct human required
- Owner Assignment Gate: PASS
- QA Independence Gate: EXCEPTION REQUIRED
- Delivery Model: Concentrated Team
- Change Risk: High
- Verification Mode: Mixed
- Technical Verification Gate: PASS
- Assurance Policy: N/A — High-risk work cannot use solo policy approval
- Risk Acceptance Owner: ROCKL
- Business Acceptance Gate: PENDING
- Release Authorization Gate: PENDING
- Estimate Unit: Ideal Hours
- Execution Model: Hybrid
- Primary Executor: ROCKL / Codex Agent
- Reuse Evidence: current Gin/GORM/Vue KB RBAC, kb_access, audit, folder_path and Agent selection code referenced by canonical plan
- Estimated Active Effort: 5～7.5h
- Estimated Implementation Active Effort: 5～7.5h
- Estimated Human Review / QA Effort: tracked separately in TASK-20260817-QA-ROCKL-01
- Estimated Parallel Elapsed Effort: N/A
- Expected Delivery Elapsed Time: Not Committed
- External Wait Excluded: review, test identities, deployment window and release authorization
- Estimate Confidence: Medium
- Actual Effort: Not Recorded
- Schedule Commitment: Not Committed
- Target Release: VONE-0.7.2.1
- Implementation Admission: PASS

## Process Profile

- Profile: Controlled
- Profile Reason: High-risk ACL and migration scope under REQ-2026-001
- Assessed At: 2026-08-17T20:34:20+08:00
- Assessed By: ROCKL / Codex recorder
- Confidence: Medium
- Required Gates: PLAN, IMPLEMENTATION_ADMISSION, L1_L2_VERIFICATION, INDEPENDENT_QA, RELEASE_AUTHORIZATION
- Skipped Gates: None
- Escalation Triggers: scope drift, authorization bypass, unsafe migration or rollback

## Execution Control

- Current Batch: T1
- Run Until: T1 exit gate
- Verification Cadence: Per WP static / Per Batch targeted / Code Complete integrated / Closure L3
- State Update Cadence: lightweight checkpoint / batch boundary
- Pause Only On: unapproved decision / dangerous external write / missing authority or environment / irreducible task blocker / unsafe worktree overlap
- Continue Without User Prompt: Yes

## Execution Batch Register

| Batch | Work Packages | Entry Gate | Exit Gate | Heavy Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | B31-B35 | Dependencies satisfied | Task technical exit gate | Per canonical plan |

## Goal

- 实现与 `folder_path` 分离的工作空间知识库集合树。

## UI Skill Selection

- Selected UI Skill: N/A
- Integration Mode: sop
- Capability Mode: plan
- Selection Evidence: non-UI task
- Fallback Skill: vone-vue-admin-ui-builder

## Scope

### In Scope

- B31-B35：collection/binding repository、service、API、可见分支裁剪、审计与 O(1) 查询策略。

### Out of Scope

- 集合权限继承、多集合挂载和文件夹级成员权限。

## Milestones

### M1

Owner Skill: `vone-fullstack-change`

- [x] collection/binding 持久层和不变量完成（B31-B33）

### M2

Owner Skill: `vone-api-contract`

- [x] 树 API、可见裁剪和审计完成（B34-B35）

## Risks

- 循环、级联删除或树继承权限会破坏范围；由 cycle/non-empty/visibility 测试缓解。

## Dependencies

- D2 collection schema 和 S1 Authorizer。

## Plan Phase Status

- Baseline Implementation: Completed and technically verified
- Governance Recovery: N/A
- Amendment: N/A
- Remaining Closure: immutable scoped commit, B48 independent runtime QA, business acceptance and release authorization

## Closure Gates

- Completion Scope: Task Technical
- Technical Verification Gate: PASS
- Change Evidence Review: Pending
- Change Evidence Report: TBD
- Workload Reconciliation: Not Assessable
- QA Independence: EXCEPTION REQUIRED
- Assurance Policy / Risk Acceptance Owner: N/A
- QA Independence Exception Reason / Scope: N/A
- QA Independence Compensating Controls / Evidence: N/A
- User Acceptance: PENDING
- Release Decision: BLOCKED
- Commit / PR: Pending explicit commit authorization; regenerate the read-only Plan immediately before commit to prevent drift
